# Heart-attack-risk-analysis-
This project analyzes lifestyle and clinical factors related to heart attack risk using an Excel and Power pivot. The goal is to build a clear and interactive dashboard that shows how different variables (such as cholesterol, triglycerides, BMI, stress, diet, sleep, sedentary hours, and physical activity) influence the probability of being at risk.
