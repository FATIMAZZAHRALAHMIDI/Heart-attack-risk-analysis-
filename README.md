# Heart-attack-risk-analysis-
The objective of this project is to analyze patient health and lifestyle data to identify key factors associated with heart attack risk. By leveraging Excel, Power Pivot, and DAX, the project aims to:
Calculate and visualize the prevalence of heart attack risk in different patient subgroups.
Examine the impact of clinical indicators (cholesterol, triglycerides, BMI, blood pressure, heart rate) on heart attack risk.
Assess the role of lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol consumption, diet, stress, sleep, physical activity) in the variation of risk.
Develop an interactive dashboard that allows users to filter by demographic and clinical variables to explore patterns and insights.

#Dataset Description
Demographics (Age, Sex, Country, Income)
Clinical values (Cholesterol, Triglycerides, Blood Pressure, BMI, Heart Rate)
Lifestyle factors (Smoking, Alcohol, Diet, Exercise, Sedentary hours, Stress level, Sleep hours)
Medical history (Diabetes, Family history, Previous heart problems, Medication use)
Target variable: Heart Attack Risk
Lifestyle Score (0–6)

#Methodology
Data Cleaning Steps with power query
Data Modeling – Loading data into Power Pivot and creating DAX measures.
Analysis – Prevalence of risk factors, correlations between numerical values and risk, subgroup analysis (sex, stress, lifestyle).
Visualization – Building an interactive dashboard with KPIs, bar charts, and slicers for filtering.
